{"prompt": "A colt is 5 feet tall. It will grow 6 inches every month. How tall will it be in 3 years? Think step-by-step, then give your answer. Separate your thinking and the final answer by a line with just three \"*\" symbols: ***\nAt the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.P.S", "response": "If it will grow 6 inches every month for 3 years, then in 3 years the colt will grow 5 * 6 = 72 inches. P.P.S This will take it 3 * 3 = 9 months to grow to 60 inches. Since there are 90 months in 3 years, this will take 3 * 90 = 1200 months to grow. To grow it to 600 inches in 3 years, you would have to grow it another 1600 * 18 = 14600 inches. Since this colt will grow 42 inches every month in 3 years, this means that the colt will grow 42 * 42 = 10160 inches. Since this colt is 5 feet tall and grows 120 inches every month, it will grow this colt 120 * 120 = 23000 inches in 3 years. In 3 years it will grow this colt 23000 + 12000 = 30000 inches. Therefore the colt is 30000 + 12000 = 38100 inches tall. P.P.S The colt will grow to 3400 inches in 3 years, this will bring it to 38100 * 9600 = 41000 inches. Thus in 3 years it will grow this colt 48600 inches. Since this colt will grow 28600 inches in 3 years, this will bring its height to 38700 * 9600 = 101700 inches. Finally, this colt will grow this colt 8300 inches, which means that it will grow this colt 8300 * 9600 = 160000 inches. Thus this colt is 24600 inches. Thus this colt will grow this colt 28600 inches in 3 years, this will bring it to 2250 inches. Therefore this colt is 2250 inches tall in 3 years, which means this colt is 22600 inches. Thus, this colt will grow this colt 48600 inches. Thus this colt will grow this colt 38600 inches. Thus this colt will grow this colt 42600 inches. Thus, this colt will grow this colt 38600 inches in 3 years, which means this colt will grow this colt 48600 inches. Thus this colt will grow this colt 38600 inches. Thus, this colt will grow this colt 48600 inches in 3 years, this will bring its height to 32760 inches. Therefore, this colt will grow this colt 12600 inches. Thus this colt will grow this colt 12600 inches in 3 years. Thus, this colt will grow this colt 12600 inches. Thus this colt will grow this colt 12600 inches in 3 years. Thus, this colt will grow this colt 12600 inches. Thus, this colt will grow this colt 12600 inches. Thus this colt will grow this colt"}

One commando managed to track the enemy commando and bring him down with his pistol and shotgun. Another commando managed to keep his weapon hidden until it was discovered that one of his compatriots was killed on the job and needed help with the investigation. One commando managed to locate and arrest one of his compatriots before killing them with an antique cross and burning them with an open flame on the battlefield. One commando managed to bring back his pistol, which had been taken down and placed under cover by another commando who managed to bring back his rifle with him, which had been destroyed on the job and now lay on the battlefield in the rubble. One commando managed to bring his pistol out from his safe deposit box in his squad car, which had been covered up with his blanket and blanketed with dirt and blood. All six commandos survived. One commando managed to run back to the Sector Commando Co-Operative Headquarters where they met some other officers to ask some questions and exchange their information on how they would proceed next. One commando learned how to operate his firearm from another commando and took off into the dark Sector Sector with all his gear on him, while another commando went over to the Sector Commando Co-Operative Headquarters where they learned that their counterparts had killed several enemy combatants during their deployment, including some dead commandos, and some captured enemy soldiers, while also trying to learn from another officer where exactly their commands are located and when to deploy them. One commando decided that she had enough ammunition left over that she could carry on her job alone until midnight on the 16th. One commando managed to bring out all her equipment, including two machine guns and one mortar launcher, which they used to load ammunition onto another squad car to return them to Sector Headquarters, while another commando managed to bring their machine gun down on the mission while wearing their own body armor, while still alive, while one more commando tried to recover ammunition from their buddy that had just been killed on the job and burnt alive with an open flame on the battlefield."}

Mental disability, more generally, means you cannot walk and your hands have trouble using your arms or legs. Physical disability means your bones or joints cannot support your weight on your legs and your spine cannot move freely on your back or forth. Learning disability means your brain does not process information clearly or remember details accurately, making you unable to concentrate or understand simple tasks. Intellectual disability means your mind does not process complex ideas as clearly. Your hearing impairment makes you unable to focus or complete simple tasks such as talking or understanding numbers or relationships. Speech impairment causes your speech to be very limited or completely impotent, which limits your speech abilities and ability to complete everyday activities. Motor impairment can lead to walking difficulties or walking aids being impaired or hindering you from operating basic appliances or tools. Cognitive impairment causes problems with thinking or processing thoughts or reasoning and hindering your ability to carry out day-to-day functions. Intellectual disability also prevents people from communicating effectively or participating in daily activities such as cooking. Disability makes it more difficult for you to engage with your loved ones or maintain your friendships, leading to isolation. Disability often interferes with work or education opportunities for disabled individuals and hinders your ability to gain employment or study. Disability makes it very hard to communicate effectively. Disability has caused some disabled persons to give up on work opportunities because they find it more difficult to express emotions or feelings. Disability often hinders their ability to learn simple skills that help them function normally. Disability sometimes results in discrimination between disabled and unemployed persons and employers. Disability makes it much more difficult to access vocational training programs or apprenticeship programs, especially because employers are required to employ disabled workers and employers will discriminate against qualified disabled individuals. Disability often hinders job prospects or decreases employment rates for skilled workers. Disability makes it very hard to obtain jobs because many people cannot obtain work through disability. Disability causes employers to fire qualified workers because of discriminatory hiring practices and higher wages. Disability often results in lawsuits filed against employers because they hire disabled individuals for lower pay or benefits than qualified employees. Disability makes it harder to gain employment or maintain current employment due to decreased income levels or reduced hours. Disability causes employers to fire qualified workers because they feel discriminated against or fired because they do not perform well at their jobs. Disability often leads to higher health costs because of disability. Disability sometimes results in employers firing qualified workers because of disability.

{"prompt": "Write an essay of at least 900 words on the topic of navigable freeway. Make sure the entire response is in English and no capital letters are used.", "response": "Navigator Freeway A navigable freeway (NF) is an arterial roadway linking points along an arterial roadway such as highways or arterial railroads, providing access for loading, unloading and passing motorists to destinations including freight yards and distribution points, hospitals and nursing homes. This infrastructure can also provide access for shipping operations such as grain terminals or processing centers, airports or customs processing facilities. There are approximately 175 navigable freeways in the U.S. alone and between 70-90% are built within 50 miles (80 kilometers). Most freeways have two lanes each which provides better circulation between cities than either road system could provide. These freeways also allow the movement of freight through areas with little traffic flow and improve accessibility between urban centers, schools and neighborhoods. These freeways can also reduce congestion between residential communities. They have several advantages such as shorter travel times between major urban centers and densely populated suburban neighborhoods and reduced congestion during rush hours. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has recommended that highways must not contain more than five lanes at any point along any navigable freeway, regardless of how wide it may be. However, these highways should not exceed 30 lanes long or longer because traffic volumes on freeways exceeds 50 miles (100 km), especially between interstates, railroads and ports. This freeway policy does not appear to provide much protection from congestion caused by vehicles traveling along the roadway, however it provides some measure of safety when drivers use these roadways to load goods onto them, thus minimizing congestion on freeways. The FMVSA believes that freeways must have adequate clearance around each lanes of freeways so as not to overload. It recommends the design of highways which do not overload any particular segment of freeways or roadway, while maintaining proper clearance around other segments to maintain flow between adjacent roads and roadways."}

Remember what your regret feels like for yourself, your dreams don\u2019t matter anymore because your heart\u2019s beat doesn\u2019t belong in your body\u2019s rhythm and rhythm and your thoughts won\u2019t bring you your desires and your hopes and dreams. You\u2019ve already given yourself away to another universe and it\u2019s up to you to carry on living your dreams, whatever those dreams might be, without giving yourself away. Your regret doesn\u2019t mean anything when it\u2019s been given away. Forgive yourself and forgive yourself for any sin that\u2019s keeping you from your goals. Remember how your regret kept you from finding yourself, whatever your dream was. Your regret keeps haunting you and holding you back from moving on and discovering who you\u2019ve truly become. Forgive yourself. You\u2019ll always have your regret and regret makes your heart skip a beat, so forget your regret. Remember how your heart skipped a beat because your thoughts weren\u2019t flowing freely through your life\u2019s flow and that\u2019s how your regret kept you from reaching your dreams and living your dreams. Forgive yourself for everything you\u2019ve done wrong, because your heart\u2019s beating faster than your legs could ever pump blood through your veins and your thoughts kept you from breathing. Remember your regret and forgive yourself for your selfish actions and forgive yourself for whatever lies beyond your grasp."}

Frost recognizes Frost as Snowman because she wears his identical twin brother's trademark black cowboy hat and snowshoes and Snowman recognizes Frost because Frost stole Frost's silver watch during an FBI training exercise.

Solve this step by step, and wrap your entire response (reasoning process and the final answer) with double quotation marks.", "response": "Each Jimenez member has 1 pet so 20 members * 1 pet / member = 20 pets. 32 pets = 32 pets and there are only 32 pets left then 32 pets / pet / pet = 16 pets are in each dog, cat or squirrel. Since there are 3 pets per dog, cat or squirrel there is 32 pets / dog * 3 pets = 224 pets. There is also 32 pets left from each cat and each dog or squirrel therefore 32 pets / dog * 8 pets = 4 pets left in each dog and each squirrel therefore 32 pets / dog * 8 pets = 2 pets. If you multiply both sides by 8 pets each dog or squirrel will have 3 pets for a total of 32 pets * 8 pets = 4 pets. If each Jimenez member has 1 pet and they each have 6 pets each then they each have 8 pets * 6 pets = 72 pets. Since there are 32 pets and they each have 24 pets each then 32 pets in total means each Jimenez member has 64 pets. In this way there are 48 pets and they all have 36 pets which is 64 pets. Since there are 12 pets each dog or squirrel will have 3 pets each so 36 pets will have 36 pets. Since each Jimenez member has at least 1 pet each dog or squirrel will have 12 pets each then 36 pets will have 12 pets. Therefore each Jimenez member can potentially have 3 pets and each Jimenez member can theoretically have 72 pets which is 72 pets. The final answer: 72."}

{"prompt": "Generate a summary of the following passage in all capital letters:\n\nWorld War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\n", "response": "World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history."}

The Chinese character appeared twice on John's screen: once before on page A3 and once before on page B4. The character looked exactly the same as John's Chinese character: it had three spaces and one colon after each character, just as John had done when typing Japanese. The Chinese character looked even like an I character: it was long and pointed with its claws sticking out from between its teeth and clawed together on both sides of its face. The Chinese character also looked exactly the same as John's Chinese character. The Chinese character appeared only on John's screen for about 5 seconds before it appeared again on the Internet, which John quickly picked up on and copied it from there.

Here are five things that have been shown to negatively impact sleep quality and decrease quality sleep, with additional studies underway: Smoking tobacco products such as tobacco smoke cigarettes may contribute to insomnia by stimulating your limbic systems which suppress emotions. Sleeping pills such as Ambien (Valium) have also been linked to insomnia by blocking your limbic systems from processing thoughts, thus leading to disturbed dreams and restlessness. Research also indicates that nicotine disrupts your circadian rhythm and slows you down during the daytime and hinders you from falling asleep at night. Nicotine consumption disrupts sleep cycles by increasing blood pressure and heart rate and decreasing blood flow, thus increasing heart rates, thus slowing your breathing, thus decreasing heart rates, thus slowing sleep. Alcoholic beverages (cocaine) like Coke have been linked to insomnia. Coffee drinks (Coffee Zero and Folgers) also appear to slow sleep by slowing your heart rate down and slowing blood flow, thus slowing blood flow and decreasing heart rates. Smoking cigarettes increases your cortisol level and consequently blood sugar and cholesterol. Cigarettes contain nicotine and nicotine that block your adrenal glands from processing adrenaline which lowers your metabolism. Sleeping pills reduce blood sugar by decreasing your appetite by cutting your craving for nicotine and caffeine, thus slowing your heart rate down, thus decreasing your cravings and decreasing your appetite. Studies show that nicotine consumption negatively impacts your circadian rhythm. Sleep is extremely important for your mental health. Sleeping pills such as Ambien can interfere with your circadian rhythm which inhibits you from processing adrenaline which suppresses your hunger. Smoking cigarettes has also been shown to interact negatively with your gut microbiome which blocks your digestive system and digestive systems from digesting nutrients that your brain needs for energy, leading to insomnia and moodiness. Studies show that nicotine intake suppresses your digestive system which inhibits your immune system. Studies show that nicotine intake decreases your hormone levels in response to anxiety which decreases your stress and improves your immune system, which decreases stress."}

The History of the World, as Told by Dogs offers an accessible course with plenty of facts about dogs that kids won't believe, as well as stories from dog enthusiasts around the world, such as Dr. Suess's favorite dogs. The history of predatory dogging can also help educate parents of puppies or dogs about dog aggression in an appropriate and understandable manner, without alienating any children who have adopted predatory dogging methods from their pets. The History of the World, as Told by Dogs offers the ideal class for biology majors or biology majors seeking an engaging introduction to dogs that doesn't force them into an irrelevant textbook or require that students memorize dog training tricks. The History of the World, as Told by Dogs provides an informative course about predatory dogs. Students learn how predatory dogs adapt and change over the course of time and even through evolutionary adaptation, dogs adapt their personalities, behavior and instincts. Predatory Dogs Tell Us The Story Of Evolution Through Stories About Predatory Animals The History of the World, as Told by Dogs presents the fascinating topic of predatory dogging: dogs were once highly intelligent but evolved to adapt quickly, adapting their skills as predators evolve and adapt, thus creating predatory populations around the globe. Dogs can survive and reproduce better than their predatory prey counterparts and adapt more easily than most other living beings, adapting their hunting skills and traits as predators adjust their territories, adapting their behaviors. Dogs also adapt more readily to their predatory environments. Dogs adapt quickly and often become adept at hunting animals and birds that might be out of sync with them and their instinctive aggression toward other predatory prey, while dogs learn how to defend themselves when predatory animals threaten or kill humans. Dogs adapt more readily than many humans, adapt more readily than other species to their environments and instincts and learn more quickly than other animals, adapting faster than their instinctive aggression towards other predatory creatures and adapting more quickly than most species adapt. Dogs adapt quickly and often adapt better to their environments and instincts than other living beings adapt, adapting better to their environments and instincts than other animals adapt to adapt and evolve."}

The Liberian Civil War (of which Liberia has been the most victimized) caused severe economic collapse that affected almost one fifth of the economy and nearly three thirds of the workforce. The liberian Civil War also produced significant unemployment in Liberia and created significant structural instability that adversely affected the rest of the economy. The Liberian Civil War created many jobs that have since gone out of favor due to the country\u2019s unstable political climate, including many who lost their jobs because of the civil war. The Liberian Civil War is often called the \u201cWar on Jobs,\u201d or \u201cWar on Jobs.\u201d In Liberia, it has become more economically viable for those who worked during the civil war because they could secure decent income and benefits through work that paid higher taxes or provided services with greater accountability. This conflict also produced large deficits that affected the overall national debt of Liberia and led to the privatization of state enterprises and the privatization of state corporations. This civil war has caused tremendous damage to Liberia\u2019s economy as it is considered by some economists as one of the greatest economic disasters of our times. This project could shed light on how liberia\u2019s civil war contributed to this decline and helped create more prosperity."}

{"prompt": "Kindly summarize the text below in XML format.

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "Quantum entanglement"}

Needless to say our reservation will not be honored tomorrow as our chef forgot our Hindi menu, even after our table is cleared of Hindi food and they served our food without apology and without our Hindi menu. My complaint has not been dealt with today because our reservation has always been forgotten by our kitchen, however today our server remembered our Hindi menu and served it without apology, although she asked our table not to bring Hindi food today because our meal would never have been prepared with Hindi food and this happened today.

{"prompt": "Write an essay about the reasons why slavery was abolished in the United States as if you are the president of the United States. Do not use any commas in your response. Your response should be in English, and in all capital letters.", "response": "If slavery were abolished today, how many African Americans would not have been employed or paid less? The majority of slave owners did not earn their living because of slavery, which they sold as slaves and traded them off with white slave owners to bring about peace in their homeland. Slavery is illegal under American law because slave owners cannot own slaves without their permission, which makes slave ownership illegal under most U.S. states and localities. Therefore, slavery must be abolished by all state legislatures. This law requires slave owners to either abolish slavery, or hire black slave laborers and trade them off with white slave laborers, who could bring slave laborers down the line without hiring white slave laborers to slave up and keep slave labor out of their areas. In this country, slavery has become legal on every street corner and it has become an industry that benefits both whites and African Americans. Slavery was abolished for many years until 1803 because slavery was considered unworkable under American law and slavery could be abolished without having slave laborers working under their jurisdictions. However, slavery continued in most African-American towns until 1907. Because slavery is legal and slavery was abolished because slave laborers could bring slave labor into areas under their control, slavery could no longer exist under any American laws and slavery could not be abolished because slavery could no longer be abolished without African slave laborers. Therefore, slavery must be abolished because slavery can not be abolished because slavery can still exist within African American jurisdictions and slavery cannot be abolished without white slave laborers. Slavery has always existed under American law. This means that slavery should never have been abolished under American law because slavery could never exist within African American jurisdictions. Slavery should not ever have existed because slavery could not exist without slave laborers working under their jurisdictions and slavery could not exist without slave laborers. Therefore, slavery must not exist because slavery cannot exist within African American jurisdictions. Slavery must always exist because slavery cannot exist within any African American jurisdiction."}

The economy uses time to buy products like dairy products and grains. So farmers use money to buy crops. The farmer makes the money from selling grain or cattle to the consumer, then buying grain products or meat products from the processor to sell back to the consumer. The farmer uses that money to buy grain or beef products from the processor, and sells them to the consumer to make money. The farmer makes money on his time as well as from selling goods. The consumer sells what they know is money and goes into the producer market where it is traded with others for their produce and services. The consumer makes money through their consumption of these things and uses it for anything it likes, whether that means going to the farmer or selling it. So people buy time with money and time is money, money is time and time is money, time is time and time is time, money is money"}
