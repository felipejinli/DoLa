The colt grows 25 inches / month * 3 years = 72 inches. So the colt is 72 inches tall and it grows 52 inches in 3 years = 156 inches. The colt grows 52 inches every month for 156 inches * 7 months = 4760 inches per year. The colt grows 52 inches every month for 4760 inches * 7 = 15840 inches per year. It grows 52 inches every month for 15840 inches * 3 years = 18920 inches. It grows 52 inches every month for 18840 inches * 3 years = 102000 inches per year. The colt grows 52 inches every month for 118000 inches * 7 months = 1938000 inches per year. So it grows 528000 inches every month for 118000 inches * 7 months = 1222,000 inches per year.

In 3 years it will grow 528000 inches * 138000 inches / year = 17580,000 inches per year. So its height will be 91338000 inches * 138000 inches per year = 8029,000 inches per year. It grows 528000 inches * 120000 inches / year = 5517,000 inches. In 3 years, it will grow 528000 inches * 3 years = 155558000 inches per year. So it grows 528000 inches * 137000 inches per year = 17550800 inches per year. In 3 years it will grow 528000 inches * 138000 inches / year = 185708000 inches. So the colt will grow 185708000 inches * 138000 inches / year = 122758000 inches. So its height will be 185708000 inches + 175558000 inches * 138000 inches per year = 155018000 inches.

{"prompt": "Write an article about the reality of disability. Your article must end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "Fortunately, I do know what you\u2019re going to need, so I\u2019ll share your stories with you. Disability can make us feel different than most other people, which can lead to misgivings or misgivings about others\u2019 disability, including our own. Disabilities often require help with activities we\u2019d rather have alone or with our neighbors or with someone with mobility problems. Disability often makes you feel marginalized because you\u2019ve only had the physical capability of working without disability to interact with your daily routine or activities. Disability makes us feel inferior when you\u2019re around and there\u2019s always something that\u2019s hard for you to handle or keep your legs from working, for instance, walking with an injury. My disability doesn\u2019t change this fact: It\u2019s important for everyone to learn from your disability that they\u2019re not alone and to share your disabilities with others, whether that\u2019s helping you cope or feeling supported or understanding them. Disability doesn\u2019t help people cope with loneliness and isolation. Disability often requires help from family or friends who\u2019re disabled and you don\u2019t feel supported by everyone you\u2019ve known, like me, because your disability may prevent you from working at all or engaging with friends you\u2019d rather be alone with. Disability often leads to guilt or mistrust from your disability peers who\u2019ve helped you through it, even when they\u2019ve tried to help you with some simple tasks like lifting weights or pushing yourself around. Disability sometimes results from our failure to appreciate how our disabled are related to each other or those who\u2019ve experienced discrimination, including bullying and domestic abuse. Disability sometimes leaves you with more work or relationships than you\u2019d ever had before and puts you at greater risk than you\u2019d have with anything you\u2019re trying to help yourself with. Disability sometimes even hurts when we\u2019re together as friends and neighbors or through difficult relationships or times when you\u2019ve felt excluded from our world or around you. Disability can have many devastating impacts. People can\u2019t deal with them all the time or cope with it for long enough or get along with everyone on the move or when things go wrong or become overwhelming or too hard or unattainable. Disability sometimes changes everything from living alone to dealing with our disability or relationships with those closest to us, from caring for someone\u2019s loved ones or seeing your best interests or dreams to our ability to maintain or maintain relationships and engage with them, from loving each other\u2019s needs to finding meaning and fulfillment, from communicating our strengths, our unique gifts or talents and our lives to getting around with each other\u2019s unique strengths, our needs. Disability sometimes results from being apart from our comfort zones or our isolation from one another or with those close to us that you\u2019d otherwise lack access to. Disability sometimes also has its ups and downs: Being isolated can have its own advantages. Disability sometimes even gives you freedom from your inhibitions to experience freedom or companionship with people who\u2019d rather you\u2019d have nothing to fear about or struggle with, from working through our disability issues or problems or from spending our time or our time working alone with you or someone with physical limitations or limitations."}

His mythology of mythology has shaped mythological thought throughout history and Peterson\u2019s mythology, from Greek mythology to Celtic mythology and early Middle Eastern mythology to Egyptian mythology and Egyptian folklore to ancient Greece. In Peterson\u2019s mythology, mythology has always been an essential tool to interpret biblical narrative, especially when depicted through Biblical accounts of biblical events and biblical narrative.

{"prompt": "Generate a summary of the following passage in all capital letters:\n\nWorld War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\n", "response": "World War II (German: WWII; German: WWI; or, WWI/WOI; sometimes simply as World War I; French: World War I; World War I/OW)"}

{"prompt": "Kindly summarize the text below in XML format. Make sure the summary contains less than 4 sentences.\n\nQuantum entanglement is the phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "Quantum Entanglement (quantum mechanics)."}

{"prompt": "Write a blog post about 'how to improve your writing skills' with exactly 3 bullet points in markdown format, and exactly 4 sections.\n\nBullet points are indicated by \"* \". For example:\n* Bullet 1\n* Bullet 2\n\nSections are separated by 3 asterisks: ***. For example:\n\nSection 1\n***\nSection 2\n\nYou should use words with all capital letters for at least 2 times.", "response": "Usually I\u2019d give 5 bullet points (*, *) because this is an example of what\u2019s acceptable when using bold capitals (which should be capitalized for the remainder of your sentences), and 3 bullet points. These bullet points will give you 3 sections that I\u2019ve highlighted (note that some bullet points do not always count for capital letters in sentence headings) or sections that count for punctuation or punctuation (note that I\u2019ll list bullet points when I\u2019ve marked them as \u2018+\u2019 instead). There\u2019s one bullet point (note that bullet points should always count for capital letters), but I\u2019ll split up those parts here (see bullet points)). As with everything I\u2019ve listed here, these bullet points should be capitalized (note that bullet points count for capital letters in sentence headings and punctuation) or \u2018*\u2019 (note that bullet points count for punctuation) (note that bullet points count for punctuation only when punctuation counts for punctuation) (note that bullet points count for capital letters in sentence headings) (note that bullet points count for punctuation only when bullet points count for punctuation only when bullet points count for punctuation only when bullet points count for punctuation only when bullet points count for capital letters). (Remain consistent throughout your paragraph.) This should give you plenty of practice (though there\u2019s more work to come!) when writing bullet points (see bullet points 4 below), so it\u2019s okay to include bullet points (note that bullet points count for capital letters only), or words with capital letters (note that bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters) (note that bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count for capital letters only when bullet points count count for capital letters only when bullet points count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count count"}

{"prompt": "Write a story about a family that goes camping in the woods. Your entire response should be in English and in all capital letters.", "response": "Freddie is the new Sheriff. He goes on camping trips for fun with his dog and some of the horses that go by the campsite. One night, the horses run by his truck, which crashes when it gets wet. They bring their horses and drive the dogs through a wooded area to their campsite. As the horse passes them, they spot the bear and its scent makes their tail spin and fly away. This is how they roll through the woods to reach the campground. The campground has been cleared so there aren't any bears there. This is when they meet their campsite for the night. It is very beautiful out and they sleep peacefully on their sleeping mat. The campsite has been covered by the lake with lots of waterfalls, streams, and streams. There is no shade from the lake because there are too many bears on it to swim through. There is also no shade from the treeline as there is nothing there except the trailhead which runs along the lakeshore. There are benches along the lake shore where there is shade from the animals and birds. This is why I went with this family because there were some rabbits who loved to hide there and I really like their pets and dogs. I recommend you give your pets some shade because you might end up leaving your cat outside because there are bugs everywhere. The campsite is beautiful with great views. We spent most of our time sleeping and fishing but my dogs always enjoyed swimming. My dogs didn't mind swimming though as I liked their pets very much. My dogs did like playing outside though they weren't big enough. Our campground was really small because I went alone there when we first stayed here and my dogs still sleep there. So they would sleep at our tent. My dog loves the waterfall and they took lots of photos there and went back home after swimming and playing with them. There is also a stream near the campground which I really liked because you could really hear them swimming and waddling through them. My dogs enjoyed swimming as much as they enjoyed swimming, waddling, and swimming in the waterfall. There were several dogs swimming there when I came here and there were plenty of bears swimming there to swim around and fish with. My dog would swim too because I wanted to swim! My dogs got wet when I got here! My dogs went outside when we arrived back from swimming at our campsite and I heard their dogs swimming! My dogs went for a swim! My dogs also loved swimming!
